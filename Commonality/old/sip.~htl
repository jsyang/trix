/* Statistically Improbable Phrases.
jsyang's naive-guess-implementation of how they work

As of Jul. 18, 2010, a preliminary glance at the Wikipedia article for this 
topic does not reveal much in terms of the implementation nor the technical 
details that would be required to duplicate the results of site. This is my 
attempt at a system similar in results and usefulness to the working feature on
the Amazon book review pages.


(( can we use this in determining people's interests and values?... maybe we can
create machinery to reduce an individual to a (still meaningful english)
hash value...))

what constitutes a phrase?
a phrase is an ordered sequence of words 1+ in length

to get phrases, we need a "grammar tree" (GT)

		 phrases (not explicitly present in the GT structure)
		 /     \
paragraph > sentence > word


[[phrases must be computed once we have broken the sentence into its words.
these are not just sentence fragments, but rather a collection of words that
is of arbitrary length and retains the original order of the parent sentence.]]


so for each level of parsing, we generate children for the grammar tree node:
break a paragraph into sentences,
	sentence into phrases,
	phrases into words
	
to do this, we look at the block of text from the bottom up.
words are the basic keys of this system.

for each node, we need:
	-children GT-nodes, top-to-bottom hierarchy
	-for sentences,
