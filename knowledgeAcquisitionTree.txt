Dependencies,
circular references,
can we trust other people to fill a knowledge gap? to what end?
given a problem, what are the steps needed to acquire enough knowledge to solve it? (at least a rough guideline)

can use a poll-like form that's live on some page to get some topic names and some dependencies
each IP gets to add stuff to a category if it's not there and then vote by ranking their knowledge tree
in order of ascending level of abstraction.
