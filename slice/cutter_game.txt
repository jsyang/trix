Game idea for the RIM Playbook:

line split tetris:
A block appears in the middle of the board, user either drags the block 
along the vert axis (to move it) OR drags a line across the surface of the 
block to split it at that location. Both parts "fall" into their respective 
Left/Right sides.

When the line for one side is filled, the lopsidedness of the block that appears
in the subsequent cutting board will tend towards that side. You cannot rotate 
blocks. Indefinite play time. Local high score for now.

Sounds:
Cutting, mending cut blocks to the sides, losing, next level.

Can't cut horizontally.
