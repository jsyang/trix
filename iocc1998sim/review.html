These past few days I've trying to make sense of Carl Banks' winning entry in 
the 1998 IOCCC after it appeared in some replies in /r/programming. Having seen 
it a few times before but never in the proper detail, I figured it'd be fun to 
try and make some sense of what exactly it does. The rest of the page details 
my attempt into doing so, hopefully in a coherent manner.

I'm most likely not the first person to do this but in the spirit of open 
source, I've released this document which details my progress in unobfuscating 
this work.

The original code: <a href=http://www0.us.ioccc.org/1998/banks.c>banks.c</a>
Author's doc: <a href=http://www0.us.ioccc.org/1998/banks.hint>banks.hint</a>
Author's blog entry about it: <a href=http://blog.aerojockey.com/post/iocccsim>IOCCC Flight Simulator</a>

Initial comments
    
    First observations: the code is short and, most gratefully, there are no 
    macros. Macros aren't difficult to decipher as you can just run them through
    the C preprocessor, but the resulting code can take far longer to properly
    reformat.
    
    I also won't be able to compile this code on my main machine which runs 
    Windows. Perhaps after enough progress is made, I can replace the Xlib parts 
    with something else that will make it compile.

First steps
    
    The first thing we need to do is to speed up reformatting the code, so we 
    can actually start reading it. Running it through <a href=http://astyle.sourceforge.net/>astyle</a>
    and 20 minutes of manually fixing up the aftermath gives up something like 
    this:
    
        [banks1.c]
    
    The reader will notice that quite a number of statements that both: 
    change the values of some variables and perform several operations on these
    new values before evaluating the root statement. Breaking these child 
    statements out into separate lines will make things clearer as we progress
    through the code.
    
The variables

    By order of most obviously guessed purpose:

    // Time
    G       a timeval: stores elapsed time in seconds
            and also a high-resolution value < 1e6 (microseconds)    
    _       compile time parameter for how long a simulation clock 'tick'
            should last; set to dt, never changes.
    dt      compile time: tick
    
    // Graphics
    *e      Xlib Display structure pointer (the only local variable)
    z       Xlib Window structure
    k       Xlib GC structure = Graphics Context (draws lines and other stuff like that)
    
    // Instruments
    f       char[] for the instrument readout string, pertaining to that are:
    l       true airspeed*1.7
    O       heading indicator (compass)
    i       altimeter (starting at 1000 ft)
    
    // Keyboard Input (all compile time parameters)
    IT      Increase throttle
    DT      Decrease throttle
    FD      Move stick forward
    BK      Move stick back
    LT      Move stick left
    RT      Move stick right
    CS      Center stick
    
    // Scenery data
    n       3D points' x-coord
    w       3D points' y-coord
    s       3D points' -z-coord (up is negative, down positive)
    y       number of 3D points loaded
    
First things first
    
    After replacing the single character variables with some more reasonable monikers,
    and breaking operations out into atomic statements (up until the line), we get this:
        
        [banks2.c]
    
    Looking at the first portion of the code in main(), there is a small section 
    where obvious things happen and for the sake of completeness we shall examine 
    these things:
    
        // Open a connection to X display server.
        Display* display = XOpenDisplay(0);
        
        // Initialize Window.
        window = RootWindow(display,0);
    
        // Initialize GC.
	    graphicsContext = XCreateGC(display,window,0,0);
	    
	    // Use black as the default drawing color.
	    XSetForeground(display, graphicsContext, BlackPixel(display,0));

        // Load scenery data.
        for
	    (
		    ;
		    scanf("%lf%lf%lf",sceneryX+sceneryMaxIndex,sceneryY+sceneryMaxIndex,sceneryZ+sceneryMaxIndex)+1
		    ;
		    sceneryMaxIndex++
	    );
        
        // Makes an InputOutput subwindow from the root window previously in "window".
        // Size 400x400, white background.
        window = XCreateSimpleWindow(display,window,0,0,400,400,0,0,WhitePixel(display,0));
        
        // Watch for key press events in window.
        XSelectInput(display, window, KeyPressMask);
        
        // Maps the window.
	    XMapWindow(display,window);
	
    Pretty straightforward so far. I think the scanf() call is pretty clever to throw in there,
    as EOF makes it return -1, which ends up as 0 (so quits loading!). After the next line we're 
    inside the main sim loop.
    
        [banks3.c]
        
    The timeval G defined here is only used later on as an argument to select() that represents the  
    fraction of time (microseconds) to block the execution of the sim process.
    
        struct timeval G =
        {
            0,
            dt*1e6
        };
        
            ...
    
        select(p=0,0,0,0,&G);
    
    There aren't any file descriptor sets, so nothing else really happens here. However, 
    we can break out the p=0 statement into a new line above the select to help clear things up.
    
        p = 0;
        select(0,0,0,0,&G);
    
    Additionally, a simple search for the instances of "p" reveals its purpose as the scenery 
    counter. The only other statement using p occurs in the instruments sprintf(), where it is 
    serving the purpose of making things more confusing (that is the point after all).
    
        p=l/1.7,    -->     l/1.7,
    
    We rename p to sceneryIndex and swap "p = 0" with the first statement of the scenery drawing 
    loop. Inverting the locations of the variable names also clears up the array pointer syntax,
    the for loop now becomes:
        
		// Draw all the scenery.
        for(sceneryIndex=0;sceneryIndex<sceneryMaxIndex;)
        {
            T = sceneryZ[sceneryIndex] + altitude;
            E = c - sceneryY[sceneryIndex];
            D = sceneryX[sceneryIndex] - L;
            K = D*m - B*T - H*E;
            
            W = T*r - I*E + D*P;
            D = t*D + Z*T - a*E;
            
            // Skip delimiter point (0,0,0).
            if(sceneryX[sceneryIndex] + sceneryY[sceneryIndex] + sceneryZ[sceneryIndex]==0 | K < fabs(W) | fabs(D) > K)
            {
                N = 1e4;
            }
            else
            {
                q = W/K*4E2 + 2e2;
                C = 2E2 + 4e2/K*D;
                XDrawLine(display,window,graphicsContext,N,U,q,C);
                N = q;
                U = C;
            }
            
            ++sceneryIndex;
        }
    
    Notes:
    We can remove "N - 1E4 && " from the XDrawLine() call; used for obfuscation.
    From a reference page for the XDrawLine function, we have that (N,U) and (q,C) are coords
    of the two points which form the line.
    
    An important thing to note is the difference between logical "||" and bitwise OR "|": due to
    bitwise OR's handling of the bitstream, it must evaluate both expressions to return the 
    value of the whole expression, while logical OR can quit with the first instance of a true
    value (!0). Since the if statement that checks for a delimiter point does not have other
    operations within the bitwise OR expression, both are equal in this case.
